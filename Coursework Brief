Team Members: Amin, Adam, Yaseen, Jesper, Michail


All work done is to be pushed to each member's respective folder. Try to Include multiple backup folders as development process documentation is crucial. The folders will be aptly named and if there are any questions do not hesitate to ask in the GC. We aim to finish this project by the 1st of December.




Plan:

Phase 1:
1) Review CW2 and understand the requirements for CW3. 
2) Members work on each assigned page for the GUI (Jesper does main page and navigation, Adam does second page, Yaseen does third page, Amin fourth and so on.) The guidance for the pages is in the brief folder.
